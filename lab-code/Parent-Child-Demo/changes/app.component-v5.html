<h1>From the root component</h1>

<p>Value of parent counter : {{parentCounter}}</p>

<!-- We now directly call the methods in the child component instead -->
<!-- The methods of the same name in parent component are no longer needed
     since this functionality is performed by the child component methods -->
<button (click)="myChild.incCounter()">Increment</button>
<button (click)="myChild.decCounter()">Decrement</button>

<!-- Directly access a property from the child component
Removes the need to emit an output event containing that property
as we did earlier -->
<p>Text from child : {{myChild.childText}}</p>

<!-- Removed the textChanged event binding from the child component -->
<!-- Use the myChild template reference variable to directly access the child component -->

<app-first-child #myChild [childCounter]="parentCounter" (counterChanged)="parentCounter=$event"></app-first-child>

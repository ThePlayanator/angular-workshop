<!--     Note that we use a relative route path here with '../exciting' 
    to ensure that we go back up one level to 
    http://localhost:4200/news/exciting/ExpressJS
    Otherwise using 'exciting' will direct us to 
    http://localhost:4200/news/boring/exciting/ExpressJS 
    which results in an unmatched route -->

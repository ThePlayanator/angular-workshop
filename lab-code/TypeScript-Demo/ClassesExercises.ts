/* Q1: 
Create a class Customer with the following properties of the appropriate type
- name
- amount in e-wallet
- product name
- product quantity
- product price

The class should have a constructor to initialize some of its properties, while other properties are directly initialized (you choose which)

The class should have the following methods (name the methods accordingly and provide appropriate parameters)

Method A - determines whether the customer has adequate money in their e-wallet to purchase the product at the given quantity and price. This method will return true (enough) or false (not enough)

Method B - adds a given amount to the e-wallet balance.
 */


/*
Q2. Create an object from the class from Q1 and call its two methods and verify that they work correctly.

 */


/*
Q3. Create a child /subclass LoyalCustomer from Customer. LoyalCustomer has an additional property that represents the number of years the customer has being loyal.

The customer gets a discount on the overall price they need to pay based on the number of years they have being loyal.
0 - 5: 10%
6 - 10: 30%
More than 10: 50%

Override Method A to perform the same functionality (check whether they have adequate money in their e-wallet to purchase the product at the given quantity and price), but with the new discount allowance just explained.
 */



/*
Q4. Create an object from the class from Q3 and call the overridden method to check that it works correctly.

 */



/*
Q5. Using the parameter properties format, rewrite the constructor for the class in Q1

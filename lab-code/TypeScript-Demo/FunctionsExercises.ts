/* Q2: Declare and define a function that accepts 3 string parameters, where 2 of the parameters are optional. When a parameter is provided, it is simply output to the display. This function does not return a result. */


/* Q3: Show all the different ways of calling / invoking the function from Q2  */


/* Q4: Declare and define a function that accepts 2 parameters. The first is a single number, while the second is a rest number parameter. The function finds all numbers included in the rest parameter that are larger than the first parameter, and adds these numbers together. The sum of these is returned as a result. */


/* Q5: Call the function from Q4 with 4 parameters to verify that it works correctly */
